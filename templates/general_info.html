                Tumors are the result of an evolutionary process (Nowell 1976). Clonal trees are one way to describe the evolution of 
                a tumor, and it is often helpful to visually and quantitatively compare these trees. We have implemented a 
                visualization tool, VECTr, that can take two input trees and output a visual comparison between them based on a 
                user-chosen distance metric. These distance metrics are fundamental to the comparisons and are described below.

                Since VECTr is a web based tool for visualizing clonal trees. You can begin by selecting the trees you will be visualizing. 
                We currently support <a>NEWICK</a> and <a>DOT</a> tree formats so any input tree will have to be in either format. 
                There are two example trees that are set by default but to replace those you can either select a file or input 
                the tree manually through the textbox. You can then select the file format and save your input.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parent-child is the default distance metric for the tool, however, you can slect different distance metrics using the dropdown.
                The available distance measures are Ancestor-Descendant, Parent-Child, CASet, and DISC (More information on the distance
                measures can be found below). There are two options of views for you to choose from. Single View allows you to visualize one
                distance measure at a time as well as download the visualizations. While Multi View, as the name implies, allows you to view 
                trees with multiple distance measures but does not allow for download or highlighting functionality.

                    The traditional parent-child metric counts the number of parent-child relationships that are unique to exactly 
                    one of the trees (with the parent and child connected by exactly one edge). In our implementation, every
                    parent-child pair contributes 1 to the child node if it does not appear in the other tree, and 0 otherwise.

                <p>
                    The ancestor-descendant measure generalizes the parent-child measure by allowing a contributing pair of nodes to 
                    be connected by a directed path rather than an edge. In our implementation, each ancestor-descendant pair 
                    contributes 1 if it does not appear in the other tree, and 0 otherwise. The contribution of each node is 
                    determined by the number of contributing ancestor-descendant pairs it appears in.

                <p>
                    <strong><u>Overview</u></strong>: CASet emphasizes mutation differences closer to the root of the tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If mutations i and j appear in a tree, the common ancestor set of i and j (denoted C (i, j)) 
                    consists of the set of mutations that are ancestors of both i and j.In other words, Jacc(A,B) yields a 
                    normalized symmetric difference between A and B.Which is the Average proportion of the union that isn't 
                    shared (E.g., 1 means all elements in the union are also in the intersection, 0 means no elements in the union are 
                    also in the intersection.) The CASet distance between trees Tk and Tl is computed as follows
                </p>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>
                    That is, the CASet distance measure looks at each pair of mutations present in the trees and computes the common 
                    ancestor sets of these mutations in each tree. It takes the Jaccard distance between the common ancestor sets in 
                    each tree, and then averages this across all mutation pairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a visualization perspective, the difficulty lies in visually encoding information about the distance between 
                    two trees. The key to achieving this task lies in the observation that, much like the ancestor-descendant 
                    distance measure, CASet functionally assigns a contribution to each ancestor-descendant pair of mutations, 
                    then takes the sum of those contributions. We simply need to extract the contributions of each 
                    ancestor-descendant pair, then depict them visually in the same way we depicted the ancestor-descendant distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a mutation appears near the root in the left tree, and near a leaf in the right, it will appear in many common-ancestor sets of mutations in the left 
                    tree, and few on the right. Each time such a mutation appears in a common ancestor set of two mutations lower 
                    down on a tree, its ancestor-descendant relationship with each of the lower mutations contributes towards the 
                    distance measure.

                    If mutations A and B appear in the same tree, the distinctly inherited ancestor set of A and B consists of the 
                    set of mutations that are distinct ancestors of only either A or B. The Distinctly Inherited Set Comparison (DISC) 
                    distance measure is the average Jaccard distance between all corresponding inherited ancestor sets between trees Tk and Ti:

                In mathematics, Newick tree format (or Newick notation or New Hampshire tree format) is a way of 
                representing graph-theoretical trees with edge lengths using parentheses, curly brackets and commas.
                Some example newick trees are: <br>
                <br>
                <pre>
                    (,,(,));                               no nodes are named
                    (A,B,(C,D));                           leaf nodes are named
                    (A,B,(C,D)E)F;                         all nodes are named
                    (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5);           all but root node have a distance to parent
                    (:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5):0.0;       all have a distance to parent
                    (A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);       distances and leaf names (popular)

            <h3 class="info-label">DOT</h3>
            <p>
                DOT is a graph description language. At its simplest, DOT can be used to describe an undirected graph. 
                An undirected graph shows simple relations between objects, such as friendship between people. The graph 
                keyword is used to begin a new graph, and nodes are described within curly braces. A double-hyphen (--) 
                is used to show relations between the nodes.
                <pre>
                    graph graphname {
                        a -- b -- c;
                        b -- d;
                    }
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to undirected graphs, DOT can describe directed graphs, such as flowcharts and dependency trees. 
                The syntax is the same as for undirected graphs, except the digraph keyword is used to begin the graph, and 
                an arrow (->) is used to show relationships between nodes.
                <pre>
                    digraph graphname {
                        a -> b -> c;
                        b -> d;
                    }
                </pre>
                <p>
